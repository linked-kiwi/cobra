A SABSA-inspired model for linking a cybersecurity program to business outcomes.  
  
This model represents a CISO's program as being a three tier set of strategic, tactical and operational processes as decribed in the research paper by Liu et al.  The processes deliver, or support the delivery of, controls which themselves are represented as SABSA attributes. From a business perspective, services are run from business divisions, and those services contribute to business value chains. The business services are supported by technology systems which have SABSA attributes associated with them. Risk is identified in the SABSA attributes at the point of the technology platform, and then aggregates back both to represent the effectiveness of the security program and the level of security risk in the business.
